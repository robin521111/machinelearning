## Capstone Project : DeepTesla

This project is based on Course [MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptesl/) and published on this [Github](https://github.com/nd009/capstone) 

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict the steering wheel angel from Tesla dataset based on the video of the forward roadway.

## Requirements

python 3.5 + Keras 2.0.2 + Tensorflow 1.0.1 + Jupyter Notebook + opencv3

These models are trained by P2.xlarge 4vCPUs 61GB on aws.

## Datasets and Inputs

Databases with real-traffic video data captured and extracted 10 video clips of highway driving from Tesla:

- The wheel value was extracted from the in-vehicle CAN

- A window from each video frame is cropped/extracted and provide a CSV linking the window to a wheel value.

A snapshot of video frame:

<img src="./images/img/frame_1173.jpg" width = "320" height = "180" align=center />
    
The CSV data format:

|  ts_micro         | frame_index | wheel |
|:-----------------:|:-----------:|:-----:|
|  1464305394391807 | 0           | -0.5  |
| 1464305394425141  | 1           | -0.5  | 
| 1464305394458474  | 2           | -0.5  |


in which, `ts_micro` is time stamp，`frame_index` denotes frame number，`wheel` is steering wheel angle(Based on horizontal, + is clockwise, - is anticlockwise)

The generated vedio looks like:
